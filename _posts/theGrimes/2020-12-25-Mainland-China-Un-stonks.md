## Mainland China In Hot Soup, Zomato Rating Down to 1.3

#### *Beijing alleges a resurgence of McCarthyism*

**Hyderabad, August 2020:** Angad Chatterjee, founder and chairman of Speciality Restaurants Ltd., Mainland China's holding company was caught unawares by the review bombing. "My restaurants and my employees are all 100% Indian," Mr. Chatterjee pleads to the masses on twitter.

In an exclusive interview with The Hindustan Grimes, Mr. Chatterjee griped about the activism. "Me, my company, my employees are all Indian. All the ingredients we use are Indian. Even our recipes are Indian, they only sound like they are Chinese. All this internet activism is very bad for indigenous businesses like ours."

The upper management has now made it a policy to cover up all mention of the word 'China' and its variants on shop-fronts, hoardings, banners, posters, and menu-cards, with black fabric or paint. This was in direct response to the violent incident that took place in Hyderabad last week. "Four days ago, one of our restaurant managers was beaten up by gang of nationalist hooligans. Our policy changes came into effect nationally three days ago. We cannot endanger our employees any further."

The district police has been investigating the matter. Inspector Singham, the officer-in-charge has stated that the investigation is running into some friction. The community has been hiding the suspects and are not cooperating with the police.

Two days ago, the Indian Intelligence Bureau intercepted coded messages and was able to learn of Chinese sympathisers disguising as Mainland China employees. This has led to a series of arrests simultaneously on all Mainland China premises across the country. "We have reliable information that Mainland China was a cover for multiple sleeper cells. We did not fall for their double bluff," said Mr. Kumar, director of the IB. "They will be fools to think we cannot fight the war on two fronts. We will fight both on the outside and the inside."

A Chinese spokesperson has responded on Twitter claiming this an act of McCarthyism. "They are making accusations of subversion and treason without proper regard for evidence. #India merely issued these arrests to justify itself. It cannot give one example of Indian citizens arbitrarily detained in China. Many Chinese citizens are searched, harassed, or monitored in India without cause. The ghost of #McCarthyism is rising from the dead."

When twitterati reminded him that the people arrested were Indian citizens, he retracted his earlier message and tweeted, "Understandable. Have a great day."
