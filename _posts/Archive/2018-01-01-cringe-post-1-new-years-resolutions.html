<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div dir="ltr">This past year has been a fine upward facing parabolic morale curve with the bottom appearing depressive and slow, but the end ramped up just right. As every other simple minded Bitcoin <i>speculator</i> believes, "It only goes up from here."</div><div dir="ltr"><br /></div><div dir="ltr">Let's get right <i>down</i> to the purpose of this<i> </i><i>humongously </i><i>purposeful</i> post, my resolutions. </div><div dir="ltr"><br /></div><div dir="ltr">There are a few things that I absolutely have to get done, like do a research intern in the summer, lead my team to a Gold at the iGEM Jamboree, keep posting to this blog everyday.</div><div dir="ltr"><br /></div><div dir="ltr">Then there are qualitative things that cannot be done on its own but need me to regularly and constructively work toward, say for example learn French enough to hold a conversation, place top 3 in a quiz (I'm going to Nihilant this year. So yayyyy!!), learn to play a harmonica.</div><div dir="ltr"><br /></div><div dir="ltr">Then there are tinier things that might just make a difference, like travelling (hopefully there'll be more posts about new places here), trekking (not very high hopes here), basketball and generally staying fit (don't judge me, everyone resolves to do this too), some lucid dreaming, some scriptwriting, and lastly, an ability to say NO.</div><div dir="ltr"><br /></div><div dir="ltr">Ending on a frequent yet inspiring quote by the Vijs' dog, Krishi, "Woof!"</div><div dir="ltr"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-NNhEwJWtQaw/WkpLjSMETuI/AAAAAAAAERY/E5UOqE99QdAROOfJLvx8iiqjFrr1bfDsgCLcBGAs/s1600/IMG_20180101_184550654.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1600" data-original-width="1189" height="400" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-NNhEwJWtQaw/WkpLjSMETuI/AAAAAAAAERY/E5UOqE99QdAROOfJLvx8iiqjFrr1bfDsgCLcBGAs/s400/IMG_20180101_184550654.jpg" width="297" /></a></div><div dir="ltr"><br /></div><div dir="ltr"><br /></div><div dir="ltr">(Wow!
