<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Why be thankful, when you can be of use?<br />You gain nothing, neither do you lose.<br /><br />We hear of Nature's fruits getting rotten,<br />And shrill cries of,"What have we begotten?"<br />Nature's filled with matter,<br />And matters we're overwhelmed with;<br />We're all against the slaughter,<br />But ignorant of the pith.<br /><br />Why offer thanks, and wash off our hands?<br />Let's stand upright, and run the errands.<br />Harming nature is hard, halting much harder,<br />Everything we do is a system of barter.<br />Some of us destroy, few others try repair,<br />But, all of us do it to repel despair.<br /><br />Does the bee buzz around, thanking the flowers?<br />Or do cows offer blades of grass to the God?<br />Does a seedling stop growing, pausing for others?<br />Then why are we so adamant about our abode?<br /><br />The lion doesn't thank the grasses for camouflage;<br />The bear doesn't thank the water for its catch;<br />The sparrow doesn't thank the soil for the worms;<br />Then have we lost our instinct?<br />Or do we prefer hypocrisy?<br /><br />Nature has made us evolve, it permit us to think and implement;<br />If remain naive and obsequious, we'll have to repent.<br />Respect it, utilize it, ameliorate it and sustain its presence,<br />For there's no room for gaucherie, neither for irreverence.<br />But, why be thankful, when you can be of use?<br />You gain nothing, neither do you lose.</div>
