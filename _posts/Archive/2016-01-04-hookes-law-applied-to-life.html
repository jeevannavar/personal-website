<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><i>I had an idea to write about Hooke's Law and its strikingly accurate representation of human emotions in terms of stress and strain about a month ago, but had to defer the article until today due to exams and college applications. Nevertheless, here it goes.</i><br /><div><i><br /></i></div><div>Hooke's Law states that, under certain physical conditions, the strain produced in a material is directly proportional to the stress applied on it. For simplification, consider a spring; the enlargement in its length is directly proportional to the force applied across its ends. This is an idealized behavior. But what is more interesting is the curve of stress against strain that follows it.</div><div><br /></div><div>The stress v/s strain curve for most materials is typical. In the initial linear phase, the strain is proportional to stress. But as stress increases beyond the elastic limit, the strain increases rapidly. Eventually, the material reaches a point of ultimate strength where the strain increases irrespective of whether the stress is increased or decreased. And, finally the material reaches its fracture point.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_90BZrOZ_BQ/Von-QqxMSJI/AAAAAAAAAIQ/y6ZLNHrMWTs/s1600/Stress%2Bvs%2BStrain%2BCurve.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_90BZrOZ_BQ/Von-QqxMSJI/AAAAAAAAAIQ/y6ZLNHrMWTs/s1600/Stress%2Bvs%2BStrain%2BCurve.gif" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Stress v/s Strain Curve</td></tr></tbody></table>Now, forget all the physics aspect of it. The curve not only represents the behavior of a material under stress, but also represents the emotional strain on a person under stress brilliantly.<br /><br />Most of the boys that I have encountered belong to the initial linear part of the curve. When under stress, they show signs of a proportional amount of strain. Some of the people belonging to this category are too elastic, like steel (appropriately known to have Nerves of Steel); it takes a lot of stress to produce an infinitesimal strain. Take, for example, bureaucrats, judges (not the TV reality show ones), angel investors, etc. I consider myself also to be a representative of this category (thanks to my genes). Whenever I feel I am under stress, I just take a good look at myself in the mirror, and go silent and solitary unto the next morning. But, the thought of becoming excited, happy or sad when many expect me to be just doesn't get to my mind. I can't see why most people can't be like this, if not for the fear of the world becoming dull because of all the monotonous people.<br /><br />Most of the girls that I encounter belong to the non-linear part of the curve. Even a little spark causes a wildfire. Even something as small as an original book about 'One Direction' gets them excited and jumping with joy. These are the people who find joy in the little things. But the reason I don't like it is that there is always a disaster waiting to strike. Even a mildly disappointing news like a par score in a test can push a person into depression.<br /><br />But, for all the people, the complete curve is actually applicable. After a threshold point, even the most stoic person will experience a significant amount of strain for a small stress, and then beyond the point of ultimate strength, even if the stress decreases, the strain accumulates. And finally, the person meets his fracture point, where either his body or his mind gives away. I guess we can compare this to a heart patient's condition, you give very bad news or very good news, the only place they will reach is the fracture point.<br /><br /><i>I do understand that no generalizations are accurate (including this one), but I found these observations right enough to be written about. What do you think? Which category do you belong to, the stoic or the boisterous?</i></div></div>
