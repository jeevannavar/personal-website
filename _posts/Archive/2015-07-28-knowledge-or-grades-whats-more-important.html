<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div class="MsoNormal">I don’t like to complain, but the current teaching scenario doesn’t earn any appreciation either. I hate it when my teachers break into the same old monotonous speech on marks, marks and marks. How can something as valuable as knowledge be measured in marks or grades? Is it even possible to catalogue a man based on the marks or grades he earns?<br /><br />Ever so often, my teachers tend to assign an arbitrary number of marks to each and every concept. They've developed a habit of it. Most of them, at most times, tell, "This concept is important for 2 marks"; "That definition is a definite question for 1 mark"; "One numerical is guaranteed from this concept"; "This derivation will be asked for 5 marks." I don't understand why teachers are so compelled to categorize topics based on marks assigned to them in the examinations. But, the worst bit is when they skip fundamental concepts citing the reason that no questions pertaining to such concepts are asked in examinations. They say that certain concepts are 'not important from the exam point of view' and that not studying such concepts wouldn't amount to any loss. Some ignorant students follow such teachers blindly and study only for the sake of exams. These lethargic students find the easiest ways to score the most marks with the least efforts, discovering shortcuts, finding frequently asked questions, and skipping unimportant topics. Many students are inclined to mug up the answers to the most anticipated questions in the examinations. They get ready to face the exams, but not to apply their knowledge.<br /><br />According to me, the cause for such marks-driven pedagogy is a fundamental flaw in people's ideology- people tend to judge individuals, their character, their capabilities, and everything in between, on the basis of marks. If 'A' gets 95 marks out of 100 in any arbitrary subject, then people begin to praise A to the sky; "Oh! A's so intelligent! A's so smart!'; people never take A's character, aim, interests or personality into consideration. Similarly, if 'B' gets 40 marks on the same test, then the same people begin to treat B irreverently. Most fail to consider B's circumstances; whether B was unwell or uninterested or just had other priorities and commitments. It is true that if an individual can't score good marks, then he is a bit weak in prioritizing and decision-making, but that shouldn't mar his image for a lifetime. We mustn't judge anyone by virtue of his marks. Take the example of Albert Einstein, or Thomas Edison, or even Mark Zuckerberg. Both Einstein and Edison were considered dim and foolish by pedagogues, because they rebelled against rote learning. Now, tell me, can we imagine Einstein and Edison fools, just because they didn't do well in school; or Zuckerberg as bogus because he dropped out of college?<br /><br />Knowledgeable students will garner good marks, but good marks do not imply knowledge. One shouldn't sow rotten seeds in small pots, add kilos of fertilizers and expect beautiful flowers. The time has come for education to stop centering on marks and start centering on character-building. Education should be an inspiration, not a burden. Knowledge and character must be supreme, not marks.</div></div>
