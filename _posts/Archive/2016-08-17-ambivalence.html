<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">In recent times, maybe weeks or months, a kind of vacillation has gripped my mind. Its intensity keeps growing with time, and peaks at the minute of call. This indecision is like Betaal which doesn't want to let go of me. From trying to decide which route to take back home, to planning my day, I seem to be going bonkers about what to do. Even as I am typing this line, I'm thinking about whether I should complete this piece, study physics, or just listen to Kenny Sebastien and laugh.<br /><br />This dichotomy is not just limited to indecision. I am an ambivert. I will put all my efforts to avoid speaking to someone on the phone, often even a close aide or a yesteryear friend. The Internet deserves a part of the blame. Even when I need to get some work done or some information, I avoid talking to people, even those I've known for years, for a simple reason, "I'll just Google it." Now-a-days, unsurprisingly, stopping en route and asking for directions has become obsolete; thanks to all the satellites, networks, and smart-phones. Nevertheless, often the extrovert in me wakes up. I begin to speak to complete strangers with ease. I go on a introductory spree and get to know new people and associate them with places and things. In the new college that I have come to, I have spoken to a minimum of a hundred people, but remember less than fifty of their names.<br /><br />Either because of all the ragging that took place in colleges, or due to their exaggerated portrayal in movies like 3 Idiots, a policy has been taken up in IITM: All freshie hostels should be free of higher year students. Now, this puts me in a dilemma. Am I to meet my seniors or not? I have heard about freshies being invited to seniors' rooms in the night for interaction, but never been there. I have friends who have done that and they have exceedingly different experiences to share. Some say they were made to do things, act, sing, and dance, while others say they were offered genuine advice and support. One was even offered unused almost-sparklingly new books. I currently have a small experiment going on in my head to understand the difference between what happens of people who know many seniors, and people like me who know few. I even have some subjects and data points ready!<br /><br />To pursue a job or not to was a decision I would have found daunting. But the road just got a lot steeper. Now, I have to choose and decide many things. NCC, NSS, or NSO (National Sports Organisation)? If NSO, which sport? What else do I go for? We have a club for everything: from Music, Dance, Thespian, to Comedy, Writing, Oratory, to Quiz, and Word Games, and many more. And for someone who doesn't fit any particular category, there is the Informals Club. And between all this, I have to study too! Just Kidding! I know why I am here, and if you would have read my previous post, you would too. Let's hope I get to use some of the tricks up my sleeves, and make good decisions.</div>
