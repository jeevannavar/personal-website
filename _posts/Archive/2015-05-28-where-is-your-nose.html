<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">The other day, my friends and I caused a small stir in front of our classroom and unwittingly made some ingenuous mistakes; all this while a sly vulpine woman kept her watch on us. I am writing this, not because she scolded us, but because she lashed out at us and tried to warn us without ample knowledge of the act.<br /><br />Nowadays, people poke their noses in as many matters as possible, but never realize that they've left out their brains. People tend to gather information (or rumors) from hither and thither, and come to a conclusion spontaneously; never actually trying to know the true version of the incident from the source. This holds true especially for those people who believe it is their job to correct others.<br /><br />I have seen teachers getting frustrated scolding a student; never to realize that they don't even know half the story. They tend to see an activity, which they believe is wrong, and then there is a barrage of scoldings, comments, and suggestions. They fail to ask the most important question, 'WHY?' Slowly, but surely, a smile or even a teasing laugh comes on the victim's face, and the hell breaks loose. Have you ever realized why the student laughs? I believe there are two reasons: either he has realized his mistakes, is regretting it, and is trying to hide his feelings, or he has realized that the teacher is not interested in knowing the root of the problem and there is no way to stop the castigation.<br /><br />After all the rebuke, what is the result? The teacher gets the reputation of being a martinet and consequently the weak-hearted victims will crack a joke behind his/her back to liven things up. It is never a good idea to warn an adolescent, or any person for that matter, because he will go leaps and bounds to know the punishment you are capable of dishing out.<br /><br />I believe, the only way to correct/improve someone is to make him explain his mistakes and their causes himself, because it is only his conscience that he is answerable to. I believe only conscience can correct a person.<br /><br /><br />P.S.<br />If you find your views supporting or contradicting mine, please do look into the fascinating subject of psychology.</div>
