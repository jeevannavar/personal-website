<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Self contentment brings happiness,<br />But does the happiness need self?<br /><br />For if I loved books, I'd be a librarian;<br />If I loved food, I'd be a cook;<br />If I loved money, I'd be a banker;<br />But does this contentment have an end?<br /><br />I am content,<br />When my house is my home,<br />When there is conversation in silence,<br />When my thoughts aren't solitary,<br />Even when I'm asleep.<br /><br />But one mustn't stop with complacency;<br />For I'd rather be incomplete,<br />Than stay in the dark,<br />And assume I'm complete.&nbsp;</div>
