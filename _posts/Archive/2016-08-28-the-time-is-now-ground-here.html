<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Its 9'o'clock in the night. The TV room is filled with overly excited cricket fans watching a T20 match between India and West Indies. The room can easily fit 50-60 people. I lie not; Right now there's no place to step in. I&nbsp; just left and had to step over some feet to get back to my room. That's right, I'm not one of those fans who'll watch the whole match. So, I'm sitting in my room with a wireless keyboard in my lap and my roommate's laptop on the other side of the room.<br />Right place? I don't know.<br /><br />I have an assignment to complete, a tutorial to solve, programs to write for tomorrow's laboratory, and revise for the quizzes beginning Thursday. Listening to my roomie's mixed English-Hindi-Punjabi playlist, even I'm thinking , as much as you are, if not more, why I am typing this. There's a cricket match going on. I studied in the morning; Played badminton in the evening; Shouldn't I just shut down?<br />Right time? I don't know.<br /><br />Looking inside, I feel like I've been living a dual life of sorts. Dreaming of a big future, of going to far away lands and doing elaborate things. A place, hypothetical presently, where I am no more thinking of the future, When I know what I want to do and am doing it. Only when I contrasted it with my present did I realize how much I am adjusting and scraping through everything. If we had to literally step into the next day everyday, I would spend the whole day thinking if I should, and eventually just step into it anyway, just so that I can think about what'll happen days later.<br />Right situation? I don't know.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
