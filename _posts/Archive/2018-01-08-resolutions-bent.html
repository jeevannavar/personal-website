It happened towards the end of the recent summer vacations too. A book reading spree. Proud. During the end of summer, it was the Hunger Games trilogy, and the entire Harry Potter series (<i>the initial seven</i>), and maybe one by John Grisham. </div><div dir="ltr"><br /></div><div dir="ltr">This time it's novellas. The Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka. The Old Man and the Sea by Ernest Hemingway (which is a very moving <u>story</u>; more about it later). And now I'm reading The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams. H2G2 is a very fun read.&nbsp; I'm still only halfway through it but the narration is done too well to be not talked about, specially the way he diffuses the tension of suspense. </div><div dir="ltr"><br /></div><div dir="ltr">I need to leave now. <br />Deep Thought's seven and a half million years are almost up.<br />Check in tomorrow for more.<br /></div></div>
