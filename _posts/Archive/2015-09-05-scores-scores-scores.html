<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Scores will score good scores,<br />What can we infer from them?<br />Will we be knowledgeable citizens?<br />Or just laymen with huge recollections?<br /><br />Do scores have a role, even when the questions are easily predicted?<br />Or is it just a formality, that needs to be completed?<br />Do scores reflect test-taker's expertise, or the test's level of ease?<br />Or do they show one's capacity to mug up, or one's ability to duplicate?<br /><br />A dolt who can't tell a lion from a buck,<br />Gets great scores by sheer luck;<br />Who's the culprit of the dolt's duncehood;<br />The tester, the testee or the proctor?<br /><br />Concepts are the core we fail to comprehend,<br />And use the scores to defend,<br />Parents and peers we may offend,<br />But, eventually, against what else to fend?<br /><br />The clever judge their own scores, assimilate the data,<br />The less endowed compare;<br />Anxiety, depression, fury - the emotions run wild,<br />The dust settles in the desert of lost hope.<br /><br />Scores are stars, but can we land on them?<br />We need a check, seldom, but we need not depend.</div>
