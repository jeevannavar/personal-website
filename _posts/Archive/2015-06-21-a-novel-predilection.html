<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Over the past few years, I've developed an affinity for novels in the mystery, suspense, thriller and conspiracy genre. I've gone onto read novels written by Dan Brown, Robert Ludlum, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Stieg Larsson.<br /><br />The penchant for mystery novels began when I was in class 5. I had borrowed the first edition of Famous Five, by Enid Blyton, from the new library in the township. The Famous Five kept me so engrossed that I couldn't let go without reading the entire series. I was effectively hooked on, reading an edition every week. I managed to read 18 out of the 21 book series in the year, since 2 of them were damaged and 1 missing from the library. All-in-all, the Famous Five brought me to the mystery adventure genre.<br /><br />Over the next two years, I experimented reading books from authors like O. Henry and Chetan Bhagat, but nothing could satiate that lust for mystery and adventure. Later, my sis bought an edition of Dan Brown's The da Vinci Code, but couldn't finish it. When I managed to get my hands on it, I couldn't put it down. I was mesmerized by the conspiracy, the mystery and the thrill it enveloped. The in -a-day narration and attention to detail had me head-over-heels in love with the style of writing. Consequently, I devoured - Angels &amp; Demons, Deception Point, Digital Fortress, The Lost Symbol, and Inferno - all by Dan Brown. I am desperately waiting for his next novel. His conspiracy stories have left me wanting for more.<br /><br />On &nbsp;the look for more, I found Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy. He originally wrote in Swedish, but the English translations - The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, The Girl Who Played With Fire, and The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest - are superb. The characters, Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkvist are built and developed extremely well. Stieg Larsson pulls you into a wormhole and you can't escape until you read the entire trilogy.<br /><br />I'm on the hunt for more mystery and conspiracy. Do tell me if you know of any such good thrillers.</div>
