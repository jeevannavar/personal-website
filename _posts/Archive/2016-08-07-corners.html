<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">"Cozy, isn't it?"<br />I knew you'd ask,<br />If not for the curtains,<br />I'd be sure to bask.<br /><br />Comfortable, it is,<br />I am the Grouch,<br />But, take me there,<br />I'd love to crouch.<br /><br />Push me there,<br />I'll put you out,<br />I have my supports,<br />Don't need another bout.<br /><br />I'm solid, I'm colourful,<br />But, expect no pamper;<br />"It surely is cozy"<br />I'd love to answer. </div>
