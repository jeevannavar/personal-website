# Impossible List

This is my impossible list. Well, it's not completely impossible. Let's just say it is improbable, or ambitious rather. The way I see it, trying to finish things on the list is going to keep me busy, keep me challenged, and, most importantly, keep me from getting into a rut and consequently depressed.

I'm working on a bunch of things in the list right now. I will strike things out as I complete them. And then add more stuff to the list.
