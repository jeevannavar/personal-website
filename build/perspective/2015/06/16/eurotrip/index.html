We travelled the countries- England, France, Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Austria, Italy and the Vatican City.<br /><br />The build-up to the trip started two months before the actual trip itself. We had to drive from Belgaum to the city of Bangalore for document verification and bio-metrics for the U.K. Visa. Fortunately, one of my of &nbsp;maternal uncles stays in Bangalore, abating the officialism of the 400 km drive. Obtaining the Shenzhen Visa was easier as we didn't have to go in-person to apply for it.<br /><br />The build-up gained pace two weeks prior to the trip with the anxiety of deciding what to wear and what to take setting in. We bought some winter clothes although we were to visit Europe in spring, as Europe's springs are significantly cooler than our winters. One week prior to our trip, my sister was diagnosed with shopping fever and she had to visit just about every garment store in Belgaum to cure it.<br /><br />We reached Mumbai one day prior our departure for Europe, parked our car at another of my maternal uncle's home and set off in a cab at 10 in the night, thus kick-starting our trip.<br /><br /><b>DAY 1</b><br />0000 IST<br />We're here, at last! Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport: Terminal 2! Luckily, the Meru Cab came on time and drrropped us off competently. At first glance, the terminus looks mesmerizing and magical.<br /><br />0005 IST<br />Where is the tour coordinator? Tring Tring... Tring Tring.... Tring Tring.... No answer. I guess, we were too early for our 0640 departure, but the feeling of impatience stayed inexorable.<br /><br />0100 IST<br />Still no sign of any Kesari representative!! (By the way, we were travelling with Kesari Tours Private Limited) We just strolled around CSIA terminal 2 admiring its mind-boggling architecture.<br /><br />0200 IST<br />Yet more waiting! And no sleep! Walking around the terminal, I saw 2 couples with Kesari apparel. I deduced that they might be from out tour group. After surreptitiously watching them, I was engulfed by a strange feeling: Had we forgotten to pack something or had they over-packed? (The latter turned out to be true)<br /><br />0300 IST<br />Kesari representatives turn up. We meet our tour leader, Mr. Jayesh Mhatre, for the first time (More about him in later sections). It turns out that we were part of the season's first Eurotrip. But, the arrival of Kesari was as much painful as joyous because they brought so much snacks and other stuff that we had to repack our stuff at the terminus! In the next three hours, we checked in, got through security check and emigration and landed at Duty Free Mumbai Shops. I don't get the concept of &nbsp;Duty Free; The prices they sell at are sky-high anyway, around 10 times the actual price, what more taxes were they going to levy?<br /><br />0640 - 1340 IST<br />My first international flight from Mumbai to Istanbul aboard a BOEING 777-300ER. Our seats were shuffled and I had to sit in an aisle different from mom, dad and sis'. I even had to sacrifice my window seat for an unruly couple. The breakfast on-board was a total enigma. I spent my time playing video games and watching Hangover III and a few episodes of Big Bang Theory.<br /><br />We tasted some Turkish Delight at Istanbul Airport. It tastes very much like the Indian Halwa, but is richer in taste and nutrition. Then, we were off to London in an Airbus 330.<br /><br />1440 GMT<br />We landed in Heathrow, but it took us two hours for immigration and baggage collection. Then, we went straight to Holiday Inn M4J4 for some much needed rest to prepare for the next 14 days. We spent the evening relaxing, and acquainting ourselves with Europe's cool climate.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Dg9RWeljU9w/VX2fcRTFYSI/AAAAAAAAAEM/13O6iZjjh5g/s1600/Me%2BIN%2BEurope.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="449" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Dg9RWeljU9w/VX2fcRTFYSI/AAAAAAAAAEM/13O6iZjjh5g/s640/Me%2BIN%2BEurope.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br /><b>Day 2</b><br />Early morning showers threatened to dampen our sight-seeing, but by the time we moved from the City of Westminster to The City, the skies cleared and the Sun shone through. Our first stop was the Tower of London, in The City, on the banks of river Thames (a.k.a. London ki Ganga). The tower has a very vast history, from being a castle to prison to palace and now a museum. We saw the Crown Jewels; the largest diamonds in the world, the Stars of Africa and of course, the Koh-i-Noor. We saw the Ravens of the Tower of London, the Yeomen Warders (popularly known as the Beef eaters), and the Grenadier Guards.<br /><br />We returned to the City of Westminster for lunch at Bangalore Express via the Trafalgar Square. At this moment it gets hard not to go into the following digression. Trafalgar Square has the sculptures of 4 huge lions at each of its corners. The artist who was summoned to sculpt them was famous for painting animals like dogs, horses etc., but neither had he ever sculpted nor had he seen a lion. Using his cat and dog as models, he gave the lions dog's paws and the look of a cat. Even the lions' mouth is kept open like a dog's.<br /><br />Then we made our way through Parliament Square, viewing the Houses of Parliament and the Big Ben, to the Buckingham Palace and the Victoria Monument. Many of my co-tourists felt that the Buckingham Palace is no match for the grandeur of Indian Palaces. But, I believe it is worth a view because of the power it housed and the lineage it still houses.<br /><br />In the afternoon, we visited Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum, one of the funniest parts of our trip. We posed, sometimes exceedingly stupidly, with actors, athletes, politicians, and many other notable figures. But, the best part of Tussaud's was the 4D MARVEL SHOW. The Avengers and Spiderman jumped right in front of my eyes. I was almost compelled to jump out of my seat and &nbsp;join them fight the bad guys.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: left;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2FkD14FzgdM/VX_sZZ-EjGI/AAAAAAAAAE8/2VEgYaUDXvc/s1600/Collages1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="452" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2FkD14FzgdM/VX_sZZ-EjGI/AAAAAAAAAE8/2VEgYaUDXvc/s640/Collages1.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Glimpses of Madame Tussaud's</td></tr></tbody></table>As the Sun descended, we took a ride on the Coka Cola London Eye, grabbing a spectacular view of the sunset and the London skyline along the Thames.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/--dIzJb9ZHsk/VX_qF7nWnMI/AAAAAAAAAEg/pounPLnpJ30/s1600/collage-2015-06-16.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="372" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/--dIzJb9ZHsk/VX_qF7nWnMI/AAAAAAAAAEg/pounPLnpJ30/s640/collage-2015-06-16.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br /><br /><b><br /></b><b><br /></b><b>DAY 3</b><br />We had to wake up at 4 in the morning to catch our 8 'o' clock Eurostar train to Paris. We boarded Eurostar at St. Pancras Terminus, King's Cross Station. The journey by Eurostar was a great experience. We were travelling at 180 kmph under the English Channel and didn't even feel jerks and jolts. The view of the English and french countrysides from the large windows in the pantry car was bucolic. But, the slums surrounding the Gare du Nord, Paris (Paris' North Station) portrayed a drastically different picture of immigrants in France.<br /><br />We proceeded for lunch at Jodhpur Palace restaurant and then set out to see the beauty of Paris. We learnt about the history of Paris and the French Revolution, and roamed the streets of Paris. One striking thing is the similarity in structure of the buildings.&nbsp;We saw the Louvre Museum, the Jardin des Tuileries (Tuileries Garden), the Place de la Concorde (Concorde Square), Avenue des Champs-Élysées, the Grand Palais (Palace) and many of the 37 bridges on the Seine. Pont Neuf or the New Bridge happens to be the oldest bridge in Paris at around 400 years of age. Its name, which was given to distinguish it from older bridges that were lined on both sides with houses, has remained.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-TyTguynLD-Q/VX_5h07Z-EI/AAAAAAAAAGQ/fLN1KnAZFfE/s1600/BeFunky%2BCollage%2B%25281%2529.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-TyTguynLD-Q/VX_5h07Z-EI/AAAAAAAAAGQ/fLN1KnAZFfE/s400/BeFunky%2BCollage%2B%25281%2529.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br />In the evening, we went to the top of the Eiffel Tower, observing the beauty of Paris' city planning with the backdrop of an equally beautiful sunset. The panoramic view of the city reveals the stunning pattern in the structure and arrangement of buildings. Many of the city blocks actually appear to be shaped as pizza slices. At around 8 'o' clock, we adored the night view of Paris in a cruise in the Seine.<br /><br />Feel Good Factor:<br />We were in Paris, considered by many as the center of Europe.<br /><br /><br /><b>DAY 4</b><br />We allocated the whole day for Disneyland Paris (a.k.a. Euro-Disney). Well, nearly the whole day, as we took the wrong exit from the expressway and managed to reach Disneyland only at 12 'o' clock. The enchanting land requires at least 2-3 days to see and feel, but unfortunately we only had 6 hours to explore it.<br /><br />I went on the following rides:<br /><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><i>"it's a small world"</i>: The happiest cruise that ever sailed around the world.</li><li><i>Captain EO</i>: A fantastic 3D film relating the adventures of Captain EO, alias Michael Jackson, featuring a rhythm-packed musical soundtrack and a whole host of dazzling special effects.</li><li><i>Indiana Jones and the Temple of Peril</i>: Face the wrath of the gods on a mine car looping at high speed through ancient temple ruins.</li><li><i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i>: An adventurous cruise through a pirate attack on a Spanish fortress.</li><li><i>Big Thunder Mountain</i>: Hurtling through an abandoned gold mine at breathtaking speed aboard a runaway mine train!</li></ul><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6v_lN94ZFxY/VX_5hmGcA5I/AAAAAAAAAGU/EaXFNmFWoyg/s1600/BeFunky%2BCollage%2B%25282%2529.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6v_lN94ZFxY/VX_5hmGcA5I/AAAAAAAAAGU/EaXFNmFWoyg/s400/BeFunky%2BCollage%2B%25282%2529.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br />We had some tongue tingling, stomach filling hot pizza, pasta and gingerbread at the peppy African jungle themed eatery, <i>Colonel Hathi's Pizza Outpost</i>.</div><div><br /></div><div>At the day's end was the Disneyland Parade, which I felt would be more amusing for a 6 year old kid than to me. I do appreciate the beauty, the hard-work and the technology behind it, but it just wasn't for me. For me, Disneyland was characterized by the bursts of adrenaline, riding the thundering, spine-chilling roller-coasters.</div><div><br /></div><div>Feel Good Factor:</div><div>DISNEYLAND!!!</div><div><br /></div><div><b>DAY 5</b></div><div>We had breakfast in Paris and drove 3 hours continuously to reach Brussels, Belgium. Did you know that Brussels is a 1 hour drive away from 4 different countries. Also, Brussels is called the Capital of Europe, since the European Union is head-quartered there.<br /><br />As soon as we entered Brussels, we visited the Atomium. It makes for a great picture with one holding the balls (actually, they're supposed to be electrons according to an old disproved atomic model). Post lunch, we proceeded to the Grand Place Square via the statue of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza. The Grand Place or Grote Markt looks exquisite with all the gold laden buildings and their roofs. We had waited long to see the naked symbol of Brussels, the Manneken Pis, but the sheer magnitude of the statue blew us away. It is the life size statue of a 2 year old baby!! We even bought some belgian dark chocolates, and waffles with extra cream and chocolate on top. (My shirt managed to gather more cream than my mouth: tasty in my mouth, but sticky on my shirt!)<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-NcXufThvBAY/VX_tqKitcEI/AAAAAAAAAFY/4Nv3uZMtnpA/s1600/Me%2BIN%2BEurope3.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="452" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-NcXufThvBAY/VX_tqKitcEI/AAAAAAAAAFY/4Nv3uZMtnpA/s640/Me%2BIN%2BEurope3.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />Then, we went on a 4-hour long journey into the Netherlands and had dinner at Invitation Restaurant, Noordwijkerhout. The restaurant had a beautiful and serene lake-view, and the dim lights in the dark night helped get rid of all the boredom and stress from the 7-hour journey.<br /><br />Feel Good Factor:<br />Breakfast &nbsp;in France<br />Lunch in Belgium<br />Dinner in Netherlands<br /><br /><b>DAY 6</b><br />A soon as I wake up in the morning, I open the huge windows of our room and what should I see? Flowers everywhere: flower fields in every direction, all the way to the horizon; red, yellow, blue, violet, you name the colour you want. The previous night, we had arrived in the darkest of nights. We had high expectations of the tulips, but actually seeing the fields shattered them all.<br /><br />At around 10 in the morning, we reached Keukenhof (Tulip Garden) at Lisse. There were flowers in full bloom up to the boundaries of my vision, but a sort of gloom had set in. My mood had gone downhill, and whenever I am in a bad mood, all wrong things happen around me (usually because of me). I learnt this the hard way that day. First, in the souvenir shop at Keukenhof, I dropped nearly a dozen chocolates from the rack. Then, when we were at McDonald's for lunch, I dropped and spilled half a bottle of Coke on the floor. Then, at the dinner table, I dropped a bottle cap into my plate. (Fortunately, the bottle didn't follow the cap into my plate.) I guess, many things drop with the mood.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zvv5DIq1Q5I/VX_sWweQOTI/AAAAAAAAAEs/GDbdVTZ6_24/s1600/EUROPE%2B20153.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="452" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zvv5DIq1Q5I/VX_sWweQOTI/AAAAAAAAAEs/GDbdVTZ6_24/s640/EUROPE%2B20153.jpg" width="640" /></a></div>After lunch at McD's, we went for a canal cruise ride in the City of 100 Canals and 1000 Bridges, Amsterdam. Amsterdam is more famous for 3 things- drugs, dine and bikes. Amsterdam is beautiful, but our time in it wasn't. The atmosphere was great, but my mood wasn't.<br /><br />Then, we sped off to Germany, courtesy, the Autobahn. Did you know that there are no speed limits for cars on certain stretches of the Autobahn? Unfortunately, we were in a bus! We first went to Cologne to see the Cologne Cathedral, the massive Gothic structure. During World War II, the allied fighter pilots used this structure as a landmark and hence, never tried to damage it. But, currently it is under restoration to scrub off the black sooty layer on the whole of its outer surface. Then, we had dinner at Ganesha Restaurant, Cologne and called it a night.<br /><br /><b>DAY 7</b><br />We spent most of the day travelling: we had to cross Germany- North to South, from Cologne to Zug, Switzerland. But the journey was beautiful, traversing the mystical Black Forest region (Schwarzwald) of Germany and the Magical hills of Switzerland.<br /><br />This part of the journey happened to be the official introduction of the tour group and I will follow the same thread. I was part of a group of 27, including 2 families, 6 couples (2 newly weds), 2 loners and 4 trainees, led by a charismatic tour leader. The jolly group was the reason why the journey didn't seem so gloomy and boring. We played together, sang together and laughed together. The whole group seemed like a family, and I would have bonded better had I been more gregarious. We were driven around in 9 countries by Robert, a Pole (as in a Polish citizen) in a Polish bus.<br /><br />We stopped at a Cuckoo Clock Factory (Hofgut Sternen) at Drubba, Titisee in the Black Forest region. The whole workshop/store doubled up as a huge cuckoo clock. I was awestruck at the sight of the variety of cuckoo clocks on show and the craftsmanship and technique that goes into each one of them. we even had lunch there and in desserts, we had Black Forest pastry. (Devouring yummy Black Forest in Black Forest! What more could I ask for?) Then, it was time to say bye-bye to Germany and hello to Switzerland.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-HT6pkghOTjI/VX_2NSdfsLI/AAAAAAAAAF8/3xZI99zKa4s/s1600/germany%2Bcollage.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-HT6pkghOTjI/VX_2NSdfsLI/AAAAAAAAAF8/3xZI99zKa4s/s400/germany%2Bcollage.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div>Here, we first visited the Rhine Falls. There was a slight drizzle and hence, we had to wear ponchos. The waterfall looks beautiful from a distance, but when we reached a boulder at the base of the falls by a boat and climbed on top of it, the experience was exhilarating. The combination of the drizzling rain and the water spraying from the falls made for an ineffable experience; and the sound of water, UNFORGETTABLE.<br /><br />Then, we went to Zug, near Lucerne to rest for the night.<br /><br />Feel Good Factor:<br />RHINE FALLS; Water Above, Water below, Water All Around...!!<br /><br /><b>DAY 8</b><br />We went atop Mt. Titilis and even had ice cream in the middle of all the snow. The bliss of having snow all around you can't be explained in words. Its just sheer adrenaline, dopamine and endorphins.<br /><br />We made our way back down in the afternoon and went to Lucerne. We saw The Lion Monument representing the back-stabbed fallen soldier, while sipping a cup of hot Indian Masala Tea. Then, while everyone else went on a shopping spree, we explored the streets of Lucerne, trying to understand the history, culture and architecture of Switzerland. We later sat on the banks of Lucerne Lake, enjoying the cool breeze and the setting Sun, and soaking in the Swiss Aura.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-eG98xj5NTbo/VX_2P1GUlgI/AAAAAAAAAGE/N3fxmLYhT1Q/s1600/BeFunky%2BCollage.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-eG98xj5NTbo/VX_2P1GUlgI/AAAAAAAAAGE/N3fxmLYhT1Q/s400/BeFunky%2BCollage.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div>We had dinner on a cruise in the Lucerne Lake. Then, while everyone danced on the deck, I was overcome by memories of a dear one. I sat alone at the back of the cruise, feeling emotions I had never felt before. The ripples in the water seemed to reflect the ripples in my heart. For the first time in my life, I was emotional!<br /><br />Feel Good Factor:<br />Snow..!!<br /><br /><b>DAY 9</b><br />We went to Jungfraujoch (a.k.a. Top of Europe) by cogwheel train. The whole day, we had fun in the snow. We even had a snow fight between Kesari Mandali &nbsp;(our tour leader and his apprentices) and Bhidu Company (Sanskruti, Samruddhi, Sanskar, my sis Anisha and me). We bombarded one another with snow atop the mountain, in the train and even on the streets. Everyone was so busy with the snow fight that no one cared to click any pictures. This is just what I felt from day 1: Forget the photos and cameras, and enjoy the moment.<br /><br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WOUB6sq3IsA/VX_sY-NogYI/AAAAAAAAAE0/I3lYGxJFIkM/s1600/Collages3.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="452" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WOUB6sq3IsA/VX_sY-NogYI/AAAAAAAAAE0/I3lYGxJFIkM/s640/Collages3.jpg" width="640" /></a>Feel Good Factor:<br />Snow-fight..!!!<br /><br /><b>DAY 10</b><br />After breakfast in Zug, we left for Liechtenstein, a doubly land-locked country between Switzerland and Austria. It is the sixth smallest country in the world with 36,000 happy citizens. Liechtenstein is the only country with no borders and no army. It is bordered on one side by the river Rhine and the other side by mountains. Liechtenstein and Switzerland are separated by unmanned bridges. So, on one end of the bridge, you have Switzerland and the other end, Liechtenstein.<br /><br />We visited Vaduz, the capital of Liechtenstein, and toured the city in a small road train. Surprisingly, the commentary in the train was in Hindi. Either India has very good relations with Liechtenstein or the country expects lots of tourists from India. We even had Indian lunch there. Then we headed off to Austria.<br /><br />We first visited Innsbruck. The name of the city comes from the first Bruck (bridge) on the river Inns. We even saw the Goldenes Dacht (Golden Roof) and Maria Theresien Strasse (street). Queen Maria Theresa was known as the mother-in-law of Europe, since she had 16 children and each of them was married off to a royal family in Europe. We stayed the night in Hotel Olympia, Axams atop a snow peak in the Alps.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-87EG6_PiG-Y/VX_uZrsX6qI/AAAAAAAAAFo/4bbnmBKs45s/s1600/Me%2BIN%2BEurope5.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="452" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-87EG6_PiG-Y/VX_uZrsX6qI/AAAAAAAAAFo/4bbnmBKs45s/s640/Me%2BIN%2BEurope5.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />Feel Good Factor:<br />Breakfast in Switzerland<br />Lunch in Liechtenstein<br />Dinner in Austria<br /><br /><b>DAY 11</b><br />We woke up early for a morning walk in the snow. Eventually, everybody else left and I was left to solitarily jog atop the Alps; something that I actually preferred. After the morning chores, we left for Italy's Veneta Province. We saw some beautiful vistas from Alps' snow peaks to the Italian plains to the Mediterranean Sea.<br /><br />We had lunch in New Venice and then took a Vaparetto, Water Bus ride to Venezia (Old Venice). The only unfortunate thing was that it was raining. My sister even went on to say, "Venice in Rain, Visited in Pain." But, I believe the rains were blessings in disguise. How else could we have avoided all the crowd in Venice? I stood alone in the middle of St. Mark's Square (considered by many as the busiest square in the world) and soaked in the beauty of Venice. If not for the rain, would I have been able to solitarily experience Venice's Aura? Of course not. I saw the statue of Victor Emanuel II, the Doge's Palace, the Bridge of Sighs, St. Mark's Basilica, St. Mark's Square and so many other monuments. Everything I saw in Venice is worth mentioning. That's the reason the complete city of Venice is a World Heritage Site. We even went on a Gondola ride in the canals of Venice.<br /><br />Then, we proceeded for dinner and stay in Padova.<br /><br />Feel Good Factor:<br />Jogging atop the Alps and Getting soaked in Venice.<br /><br /><b>DAY 12</b><br />We entered the Tuscany Province to visit Maranello, the home of Ferrari. My heart started racing and pounding as I saw the spectacular cars in the Ferrari Museum and the Ferrari Dealership.<br /><br />Then we went to Galileo's home-town, Pisa. We saw the Leaning Tower of Pisa in Piazza del Duomo (Pisa's Cathedral Square) and clicked photos of us holding it up. But, none of my co-tourists had a good enough sense of perspective to click a properly aligned photo of mine. And another striking thing in Pisa was street vendors selling (fake) Gucci and Prada bags for 10-20 Euros. The scenario was similar in almost every city. We saw many hawkers, usually immigrants, selling virtually everything- from ponchos to fake merchandise to cheap souvenirs.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-hIjFtw6mFQ0/VX_uZzfzMFI/AAAAAAAAAFk/h0mdfrdM2aE/s1600/Me%2BIN%2BEurope6.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="452" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-hIjFtw6mFQ0/VX_uZzfzMFI/AAAAAAAAAFk/h0mdfrdM2aE/s640/Me%2BIN%2BEurope6.jpg" width="640" /></a></div>Next on our schedule was a visit to Florence's Piazza Michelangelo and David. Michelangelo gave David the body of a well-built male, but the face of his mother. And from the viewpoint right in front of David, I saw the spectacular night skyline of Florence. Having read Dan Brown's Inferno, it was very difficult for me not to go out into Florence exploring the places where Robert Langdon had been. We settled for the night in Art-e-Hotel, Perugia, Umbria Province.<br /><br /><b>DAY 13</b><br />A common saying goes such,"All Roads Lead to Rome." I don't know of the other roads, but our's surely did. We reached Rome, Lazio Province just before noon and visited the Flavian Amphitheatre, commonly known as the Roman Colosseum. Although much of its glory has been lost to calamities, its sheer size is still staggering. We further went on a small tour of the city - viewing Piazza Venezia with the new monument, Vittoria (which happens to be 150 years old), Circus Maximus and the ruins of various forums. We then proceeded for lunch at the Maharajah Restaurant.<br /><br />Post lunch, we spent time in the Vatican City, the smallest country in the world. We entered via the Vatican Museum. Just about everywhere I turned, there was a piece of art, be it paintings, sculptures, mosaics, carvings, tapestries or frescoes. We then paid a visit to the Sistine Chapel, the most famous hall in the world. The frescoes painted by Michelangelo are magnificent, specially the Last Judgement, and the Creation and other Old Testament stories on the ceiling. There is also a small spot on the ceiling from where the paint has fallen off, but no artist has been brave enough to match Michelangelo and repaint the gap.<br /><br />We then went to St. Peter's Basilica, the largest church in the world. At every turn, there is a work of art. Every painting in the church has been replaced by mosaic, which look original and are camera-friendly. We saw the works of Bernini and Michelangelo. We then made our way into the St. Peter's Square. Then, in the evening, we went to the Trevi Fountain. Well, Rome wasn't built in a day and it can't be seen in a day either.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--ynt6vqx7xA/VX_tjaXVOTI/AAAAAAAAAFQ/W87B5seRJKQ/s1600/Me%2BIN%2BEurope4.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="452" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--ynt6vqx7xA/VX_tjaXVOTI/AAAAAAAAAFQ/W87B5seRJKQ/s640/Me%2BIN%2BEurope4.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />Feel Good Factor:<br />I was in 2 countries at the same time. One of my feet was in the Vatican City, while the other was in Italy.<br /><br /><b>DAY 14</b><br />For the first time in a fortnight, we woke up at our own pace and got ready in no hurry. We reached Fiumicino Aeroporto Internazionale Leonardo da Vinci at 1115 hours and boarded our Turkish Airlines flight to Istanbul at 1425 hours. We landed late and had to rush to catch our flight to Mumbai. We reached Mumbai the next morning, stayed at my uncle's home and drove back to Belgaum a day later.</div></div> <br /><!-- Load Facebook SDK for JavaScript --> <div id="fb-root"></div> <script> (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = "https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v3.0"; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs); })(document, "script", "facebook-jssdk"); </script> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8" ></script> <div class="share-page"> <p class="share-text">Share this on &rarr;</p> <a href="https://twitter.com/share?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" class="twitter-share-button" data-size="large" data-show-count="false" style="margin-top:5px;" >Tweet</a > </div><!-- Author box --> </div><!-- Incomment incase you want to use Disqus <div id="disqus_thread"></div> --> </article> <!--<script> var disqus_config = function () { this.page.url = "/perspective/2015/06/16/eurotrip/"; /* Replace PAGE_URL with your page's canonical URL variable */ this.page.identifier = "/perspective/2015/06/16/eurotrip"; /* Replace PAGE_IDENTIFIER with your page's unique identifier variable */ }; (function () { /* DON'T EDIT BELOW THIS LINE */ var d = document, s = d.createElement('script'); s.src = 'https://.disqus.com/embed.js'; s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date()); (d.head || d.body).appendChild(s); })(); </script> <noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a> </noscript>--> </div> </div> <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-4 offset-md-2"> <div class="card"> <div class="card-header">About Aditya Jeevannavar</div> <div class="card-body"> <p class="author_bio">I conduct bioinformatics research as my dayjob and continue to stare at my laptop screen writing and tinkering on side-projects the rest of the day.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="col-md-4"> <div class="card"> <div class="card-header">Useful Links</div> <div class="card-body text-dark"> <li> <a href="/">Home</a> </li> <li> <a href="/about">About</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog">Blog</a> </li> <li> <a href="/cv">Curriculum Vitae</a> </li> <li> <a href="/impossible">Impossible List</a> </li> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <br> <br> <br><footer> <p> Powered by <a href="https://github.com/sujaykundu777/devlopr-jekyll">devlopr jekyll</a>. <br> Subscribe via <a href=" /feed.xml ">RSS</a><br> &#169; Aditya Jeevannavar 2021 </p> </footer> <script> var options = { classname: 'my-class', id: 'my-id' }; var nanobar = new Nanobar( options ); nanobar.go( 30 ); nanobar.go( 76 ); nanobar.go(100); </script> <div hidden id="snipcart" data-api-key="Y2I1NTAyNWYtMTNkMy00ODg0LWE4NDItNTZhYzUxNzJkZTI5NjM3MDI4NTUzNzYyMjQ4NzU0"></div> <script src="https://cdn.snipcart.com/themes/v3.0.0-beta.3/default/snipcart.js" defer></script> <script src="/assets/js/mode-switcher.js"></script> <script> if (window.netlifyIdentity) { window.netlifyIdentity.on("init", user => { if (!user) { window.netlifyIdentity.on("login", () => { document.location.href = "/admin/"; }); } }); } </script> </body> </html>
