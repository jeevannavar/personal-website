<p><strong>Gandhinagar, May 2021</strong>: A sting operation by <a href="https://thegrimes.substack.com">The Hindustan Grimes</a> in association with CID Gujarat has revealed operations of the BJP IT Cellâ€™s West Wing (WW). The covert operation, led by our very own Momo, began in early January this year. There is speculation that The Grimes was started as a front for the operation.</p>

<p>â€œThe IT Cell always reached me through the grapevine, but finding them directly took a lot of effort,â€ said a visibly ruffled Momo. â€œIt began with a lot of hanging around family groups and neighbourhood unclesâ€™ groups. That yielded only forwards. Then, we started setting our own traps. One of my avatars went in so deep, it got the forwards before they were even labelled forwards.â€</p>

<p>â€œFinally, we found one of their creativesâ€™ real facebook account,â€ Momo continued. â€œWe made up an advertising account and asked FB for his address so we could sell him banyans and they just gave it to us. That is when the whole operation went sour.â€</p>

<p>It turns out that the IT Cell operative that the operation found was quite normal and did not need to be especially tortured to speak about the Cellâ€™s operations. She was quite friendly and spoke openly.</p>

<p>The WW IT Cell, internally known as Forward Factory, primarily consists of struggling writers who never made it in mainstream writing. â€œThere is no long form reading audience thatâ€™ll connect with our Indian stories,â€ she said. â€œAnd Bollywood doesnâ€™t like writers getting creative, so this is the only choice. It even pays well.â€</p>

<p>The IT Cell writers add that they donâ€™t have faith in the conventional news agencies. One, they donâ€™t have the money, and the onesâ€™ that do have money shouldnâ€™t be called news agencies anyway. Two, they write just about anything. Three, you are forced to write about celebrities or politicians all the time. â€œAt least we donâ€™t say itâ€™s all true and sign our names under it,â€ said an anonymous writer, who goes by @shambiguity.</p>

<p>â€œFF takes care of us,â€ said @mrpatel, another writer. â€œThe IT Cells up north are generally okay. But some of the Cells in the fringes are almost prison cells and are run like <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-50883161">Chinese card factories</a>. Those imprisoned indentured slave-like writers donâ€™t even get EPFO.â€</p>

<p>The sting operation also revealed that multiple attempts at unionisation of the writers have been crushed, sometimes with the involvement of police officers. Suspected officers have been put on paid suspension. It is believed that the PM appreciates IT Cellsâ€™ growth and views them as successes of Aatmanirbharata and Make in India programs, but is also in talks with Amazon for their expertise. â€œNo one crushes unionisation attempts and exploits workers like they do. Every capitalist could learn a thing or two from Amazon,â€ said Dr. Subramanian Swamy, MP and former professor of economics.</p>

<p>The PMO has said that this was one of the avenues for creating employment for the youth in the country. The IT Cellsâ€™ funding was accounted for in the union budget. Upon enquiry about why this was not revealed earlier, the PMO confessed to a large backlog of announcements. â€œWe have some announcements pending since last December,â€ said the PMO reply. â€œWeâ€™ve not even got to the announcements about placing orders for vaccines for 18-44! Oh wait! We still have to place the orders first.â€</p>

<p>Television news broadcasters however have ignored the sting operation in favour of the failed return attempts of COVID19, IPL, and Sushant Singh Rajput.</p>
